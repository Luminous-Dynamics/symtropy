# Φ-gated motor authority — paper artifacts

Supporting code, data, and figures for the IWAI / Active Inference Journal
paper on consciousness-inspired supervisory control across heterogeneous
robot platforms. The paper establishes a minimal 2-part sufficient
condition for a scalar-signal → gain supervisor that beats binary
ISO/TS 15066 SSM under epistemic uncertainty about the human-motion
envelope, and shows the result replicates to a second platform
(quadrotor).

> **Terminology**: "Φ" in this paper is shorthand for the scalar output

> integration index* aggregating 10 sub-signals. It is **not** Tononi
> IIT Φ in the phenomenological sense, and the method's empirical
> validity does not depend on IIT's axioms being correct. The library
> primitive `sprint_floor_gain(signal, sprint_threshold, floor)` takes
> an arbitrary scalar — any correlate that discriminates "confident

## Contents

### Prose
- `OUTLINE.md` — 10-section paper outline with commit-map, bounded
  claims, abstract draft (149/150 words), pre-writing checklist (7/7
  closed), and §9.1 Crazyflie hardware-validation plan.
- `DRAFT.md` — first prose draft of the full paper (~5000 words).
  All §1–§10 written; every empirical number matches current-code
  benchmarks; ready for review + submission-prep polish (LaTeX
  conversion, bibliography formatting, word-count verification).

### Figures
- `figures/figure1_phi_trace.png` — 40 s Φ trace showing the narrow
  empirical band [0.099, 0.145] vs the default `SafetyTier` thresholds
  (Green > 0.6 etc.) that never fire. Motivates the recalibration
  argument.
- `figures/figure2_sp_sweep.png` — Headline S_p sweep. ISO SSM cycles
  collapse 7 → 0 across S_p ∈ {0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 2.25, 2.5, 3.0} m;
  Φ-SprintFloor holds ~0.8 cyc/100s. Crossover at S_p = 2.5 m at
  **+71.4 %** (N=30, 95 % CI [+15.4, +127.4]) under post-FEP-wiring
  code. Pre-wiring version claimed +178.6 %; see §9.2.
- `figures/figure3_flight_benchmark.png` — Second-platform replication
  on the quadrotor. TierGate 0.180 ± 0.078 N (20.8 % red-frames);
  SprintFloor 0.275 ± 0.040 N (0 % red-frames). Paired advantage
  **+71.4 %**, 95 % CI [+54.1, +88.6] at N=30.
- `figures/figure4_phi_invariance.png` — Structural Φ-invariance
  across platforms. 1,000-tick traces from 6 platforms overlaid —
  all produce the identical band [0.103, 0.145]. Mechanism:
  `RoboticAgent::tick` builds `ConsciousnessInputs` purely from
  `danger_level`; observation vector is discarded. See §8.
- `figures/figure5_paired_live.png` — Cross-platform paired live-Φ
  replication. Six platforms × 30 trials each × TierGate vs
  SprintFloor at each platform's applied SPRINT_THRESHOLD. All 6
  advantages positive, all CIs exclude zero. Range +89 % (auv) to
  +231 % (vehicle), mean +170.6 %. Data: `data/paired_benchmark_
  live_n30.csv`, reproducer: `paired_benchmark_live.rs` example.
- `figures/figure6_flight_training.png` — Flight controller BPTT
  training curve. 50 episodes × 1000 steps, CPU, 6.4 min wall.
  Position error -88.0 %, attitude error -84.9 %, hover fraction
  → 90-100 % by episode 45. Closes the §9 "untrained controllers"
  limitation with concrete convergence evidence. Data:
  `data/flight_training_50ep.csv`, reproducer: `train_flight.rs`.
- `figures/render_figures.py` — Pure-matplotlib renderer for all three
  figures. Dependencies via `nix-shell` (see Reproducing below).

### Data
- `data/phi_trace_40s.csv` — 1000 samples from
  `MANIP_BENCH_PHI_TRACE=1 cargo run -p symtropy-manipulator-demo
  --example manipulator_benchmark --release`. Feeds Figure 1.
- `data/sp_sweep_results.csv` — Summary table used by Figure 2
  (N=30 for ISO/Adaptive, N=10 for Φ variants).
- `data/sp_sweep_n30/` — Six raw log files from the full N=30 sweep
  (`sp_{0.5,1.0,2.0,2.25,2.5,3.0}.txt`, ~10 min each on this host).
- `data/sp_sweep_n30.sh` — Reproducer script for the full sweep.
- `data/monte_carlo_n30.txt` — §4 Monte Carlo reproduction anchor
  (baseline Adaptive vs ISO SSM, -75.7 % loss in standard regime).
- `data/flight_benchmark_n30.csv` — N=30 paired-trial flight benchmark,
  feeds Figure 3.

## The claim, in one sentence

Φ-gated motor authority implemented as `if Φ > sprint { 1.0 } else { floor }`
beats binary ISO/TS 15066 SSM under epistemic uncertainty about the
human-motion envelope, and the result transfers from a 7-DOF manipulator
to a 4-DOF quadrotor with no change to the supervisor code — by +71 %
at the S_p = 2.5 m crossover on each platform (manipulator N=30, CI
[+15.4, +127.4]; quadrotor N=30, CI [+54.1, +88.6]).

## What this paper is NOT claiming

- That Φ is a certified safety layer. The SOTIF / ISO 21448 framing in
  `symtropy/crates/symtropy-robotics-bridge/src/agent.rs` positions it
  as a *triggering-condition monitor* — not a replacement for certified
  hardware envelopes. Single-point-of-failure hazards (cautery, blade
  engagement) still require a Φ-independent hardware interlock; the
  surgical demo's dual-channel pattern (commit `bcd80ef6aa`) is the
  reference implementation.
- That Symthaea's consciousness model is neurally realistic. The paper
  uses "Φ" to refer to the scalar output of `MasterConsciousnessEquation`
  — not to Tononi-sense integrated information. The narrative holds
  whether or not the underlying equation has the phenomenological
  properties its designers hope for; the supervisor story is about
  continuous vs binary gating, not consciousness claims.
- That sprint-floor is universally optimal. The 2-part sufficient
  condition is a *minimal* claim: this is the *least* mapping that
  works. Richer Φ→gain maps might perform equal or better on platforms
  whose empirical Φ distributions differ materially from the
  manipulator's [0.099, 0.145] band.
