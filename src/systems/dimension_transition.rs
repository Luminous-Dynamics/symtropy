//! Camera-only dimension presets for the default 2D dungeon crawler: F1-F4
//! smoothly interpolate the (still-`Camera2d`, still-sprite-rendered) camera's
//! zoom and vertical offset between four presets. The world's actual geometry
//! never becomes 3D through this system — sprites stay flat sprites at every
//! preset.
//!
//! - **2D**: Top-down, tight zoom. (Current default)
//! - **2.5D**: Zoomed out further with a Y offset — a cheap "looking from
//!   above and behind" parallax cue, not real isometric projection.
//! - **3D**/**4D**: Historically documented as "full 3D camera with free
//!   look, walls become tall" — that was never implemented. These presets
//!   are actually just a further zoom-out/offset step, identical in kind to
//!   2.5D. A real embodied first-person/3D-mesh mode does exist in this
//!   engine (see `rendering_3d.rs`), but it's a separate, hardcoded
//!   experience (`--experience waterworks-3d`) with its own world-building
//!   pipeline, not something F3/F4 switch the default game into.
//! - **4D's W-slider** (`[`/`]` keys) is real and independent of this
//!   camera-preset confusion: it reveals/hides `FourDBody`-tagged hidden
//!   dimensional secrets (see `four_d_rendering.rs`) regardless of which
//!   camera preset is active.
//!
//! Press F1-F4 to switch presets, or use the scroll wheel to slide.
